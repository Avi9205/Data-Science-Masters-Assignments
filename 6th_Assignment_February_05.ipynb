    "Ans. The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields and methods of a class private, so that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Encapsulation allows for better control of the data and logic in the class, and helps to prevent unwanted interference from other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features to the user. Abstraction helps to simplify the programming interface, making it easier to use and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can derive properties and behaviors from another class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes the code more modular and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms, depending on the context in which they are used. Polymorphism allows for the creation of code that can work with objects of different types, making the code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements."
